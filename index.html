    <strong>What is Docker?</strong>
    <p>
      Docker is a set of tools that allows you to package, distribute, and run
      applications inside a container. It is a platform for building, shipping,
      and running distributed applications that use Docker containers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Docker helps you run your application anywhere — without worrying about
      setup, versions, or dependencies. <br /><br /><strong>“If it works on my computer,
      it works on yours too.”</strong>
